                <h2>Game Launcher</h2>
                <p>Currently, I'm working on the game launcher that allows you to modify game options before
                    launching the game and check if the game's up to date. As for now, the launcher is in an 
                    experimental phase, so expect many bugs.
                </p>

                <h2>Version 0.2.3 is coming soon</h2>
                <p>Soon, 0.2.3 is about to be released on GameJolt and Itch as a small patch, that replaces 
                    the Xbox Test room with the Options menu. Mostly, it's just going to be some shading 
                    effects and audio adjustments that will be possible to be modified in-game and from this
                    launcher. Because the game development didn't go as planned, instead of adding 6 levels
                    in 0.3 as planned, the next major update will include 12 new stages. This is going to be
                    an update that closes an alpha stage of the project.
                </p>
